# 2019-10-15: Setup GitHub, R, RStudio, Git

Based on [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR, by Jenny Bryan, the STAT 545 TAs, and Jim Hester](https://happygitwithr.com/).

## Register a free GitHub account

* Your username should be timeless, so you accumulate credit (exclude your employer; add your work email to your personal account).

* Your GitHub username, and definiterly your profile, should have your name.

This makes it easy for people to search your name and find your username. People need your username to `@mention` you on GitHub (e.g. to thank you or discuss issues).

## Install or update R and RStudio AND Install Git

How to (a) [think](https://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html#install-r-rstudio)

## Introduce yourself to Git (TODO)

```
# My ~/.gitconfig at the start
git config --global --list

#Email associated with GitHub
git config --global user.email "maurolepore@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "Mauro Lepore"

# Other very useful configurations
git config --global push.default "current"
git config --global core.editor "notepad"
git config --global credential.helper "manager"

# My ~/.gitconfig at the end
git config --global --list
```



## Prove local Git can talk to GitHub (SKIP)

Login to http://github.com/

On GitHub: 

* Create a repo
* Add description.
* Add README.md
* Copy https clone link

On Git Bash:

```
# Clone new repo and move to it
git clone <URL>
cd <new repo>

# Edit README
## Before
cat README.md
echo "A line from local computer" >> README.md
## After
cat README.md

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Edit README from local computer"
git push
```

* Check if credentials are managed correctly: Repeat edit, commit and push (you should no longer be challenged for a username and password).



## Cache your username and password or set up SSH keys (DONE)

We should be done. We already added this:

```
git config —global credential.helper manager 
```

If we need to remove your git credentials on Windows, they are here:

_Control Panel > user accounts > credential manager > Windows credentials > Generic credentials_

SSH: Skip.



## Prove RStudio can find local Git (TODO)

Login to http://github.com/

On GitHub: 

* Create a repo
* Add description.
* Add README.md
* Copy https clone link
 
On RStudio:

File > New Project ... > Version Control > Git

Edit README, commit and push.

Do it twice to confirm that the credential manager works as expected.



## Contemplate if you’d like to install an optional Git client

I recommend GitKraken: https://www.gitkraken.com/download
